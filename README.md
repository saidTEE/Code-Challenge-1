     Kenyan Chai & Simple JS Challenges.

Description
This repository contains three JavaScript programs I created to solve real-life Kenyan challenges:

- Chai Calculator: Calculates the ingredients needed for making Kenyan chai based on the number of cups.

- Boda Boda Fare Estimator: Estimates the fare for a boda boda ride using a base fare plus a per-kilometer charge.

- Transaction Fee Estimator: Calculates transaction fees with a minimum and maximum fee limit.

Each program prompts the user for input, performs the calculation, and prints a clear, formatted result to the console. I followed the challenge requirements closely, added comments for clarity, and tested to ensure everything works smoothly.
